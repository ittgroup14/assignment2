https://megakemp.com/2019/03/20/the-case-for-pull-rebase/

git pull or git pull --rebase
 
 start of your work  (is a combination of two commands fetch and merge)
 This will get you up to date with what is on the remote. But if you already have local commits use git pull --rebase
 
git status
git add
git commit -m 
 to see what you have changed and add these to your local stage.
 I use (git add . ) a lot as this adds all changed files
 -m is for message, add a description
 
git push
 if this fails, it is because the remote has changed, don't force it.
 you need to get your local up to date then you can push your changes.

git pull --rebase
 
 this will bring the remote changes into your local repo with your commits on top. Then you can push. 
 
 
 This will get complicated if you have edited a file that someone else has also edited.
 
 For us this is likely to be a .docx file, word doc, and these are complicated files. Best to abort  the pull in this case. Change the file name in your local repo, do a new commit then start to pull again. 

git diff
	will give you a list of differences between your local and the remote.
