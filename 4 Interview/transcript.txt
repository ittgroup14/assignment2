senior network engineer

multiple screens - 10 client networks you have to react to that alarm and call whatever number, could be broken equipment, dodgy cable, user error, power outage soimetime the equip fails and you have to replace it

and then eventually and so i was in that reole for 2 years then i just really wanted to focus on one client so they put me in transport for NSW, 3 days a week they liked me wanted me to be full time except i work 2 days from home and thats it

i work with a whole bunch of people clients architects, service living managers, dept heads ill deal with them when its a priority 1 or 2 call, im also a team leader and well as a team engineer, 6 subbies working under me and i have my own manager and account managers i have to deal with to make sure were not bleeding money

if we fail contracts it can be quite expensive up to 100k a month per contract

what interested me? its a natural progression from network support analyst to a more leadershiup role so im in connect but theres also a whole another area of DEC those guys they do everything 

they are starting to use us more than like AT & T  or IBM becuase its cheaper

most of the time on the client site

a lot of the services i handle are public places today i was on P2 call - that p2 was basically like the screens at the train station - they were all down acros all the cbd

there was a post on reddit about it - theres a lot of pressure coming from the client themselves to get things fixed as quick as possible so if i dont fix something fast theres going to be an impact directly on the public not just the client, public perception

minister for transport gets involved its a pretty i guess political in that sense where you have to react to things very fast youre not losing just money but public confidence

ive been in a p1 where ive had people ive never seen before were in the datacenter with me watching over my shoulder be fix something it was intense i guess its high risk high reward


i got a whole bunch of praise for that - as i said high risk high reward

automation is really big right now cloud services as well so kind of like devops as a whole is where were going - software designed networks cloud based networks centralised data centers will be T1 people like TSPT NSW or any kinda govt - they want to hybrise it AWPS, VPNS, google cloud VPN those are the big 3

one customer has 1000 applications and each one of those applications has a diff person or team behind it and theyve all chosen a diff way to implement them - and that app is available to other agencies too, for examaple face recog the police and asio use that

whole bunch of services that have been moved to the cloud is where id wanna be in 5 years -mainly due to mme having to spec too much such as architect or technical lead it would require 2 more years of study for me to get to it

recoomend? yeeah i mean starting out as a Managed service provider if youre not sure of what to do and then cause youll see what everyone does, then ill know what i wanna do like software support or maybe an IT guy just work your way up in that facet like the head of it somewhere 

theres so many things you could do MSP is a good base - working in house is obviously better youre gonna work with 1 customer youll be part of that environment wont have to worry about money except for small purchases where as currently were fighting over deliveriables like 

say like a law firm or a government agency just not as a contractor I work for MSP - which govt agency go to tender so ill manage their network its a big process us, vs mac telecom vs ibm a lot of players in australias field

not always so the sitting at the client site is generally the architects do in this case transport NSW is very big so when theres a major incident they like to have someone on hand so whenever they want a L1 or get assigned to L2 i sit next to major incident response and im basically right there and check it for them

sometimes i fix it before the ticket is created but sometimes not - it doesnt follow a set lot of rules ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
uh its 99% super chill, as im seinor if i was jnr its full on a lot of the time you are tied to your desk but i can go out and have coffee, take smoke breaks etc

overtime - i do i guess busy week 60-70 hours of total work a week i get paid for it but as you progress if you earn over 140k base - will not get OT or if you get a managerial role - im on the cusp of that im in that weird spot where im not meant to get OT but i get OT , i do on call, i do changes etc , there are people dedicated to just project work and they will work weird hours and they have to do a timesheet against every thing they do they could start at 9am maybe 3 hours of work - 5 hours of work at night and wont claim OT

changes are basically any kind of change you wanna make to the network it has to be done after 7 PM  rules around what you can do and diff levels of changes as well

uh juniors have to - its hard you cant do if you got a family not going to move up super fast without the man hours

a junior - depends it used to be a lot harder to move up i worked with people 5> years before moving to L3 analyst 

service desk analyst - l1 - l2 - level 3 (what ben is) so managing level 2 people

2 years for me and say probably 2 years is a good time and youll be passionate and want to study cause you dont just get your degree theres constant learning you gotta do - always studying or youll fall behind

youll try hire in house first if you cant get anyone you go to market - so at the moment were looking for L2 / L3 engineer but were not going to be looking for someonen <8 years exp you have to have all the certs, in our field we're a cisco house so its gonna be cisco route switch CCNA/ CCNP l2 / CCIE (architect or presales) - you dont need it but it helps cause you know wtf youre on about

CCNA CCNP CCIE routing/switching good for the next 10 to 15 years just because as things move toward software/network there wil be less network knowledge required as they wont even have control it will just be a web gui and the network will build itself - not at that stage yet - no touch provisioning any cisco based certs is good if you wanna be in that field or elsewhere, AWS, google cloud certs, security certs every single vendor firewall has there own cert a lot of these certs are one year which is a pain because you have to keep doing it , cisco is roughly 3 years .at the end of 2.75 years instead of doing it all you can just do a highest level refresher.

hybrid network right now two t1 data centers big data centers and they house multiple govt agencies not even just transport, theyre pretty crazy two huge diesel gens power the site they have this weird cooling thing pushing huge amount of airs through wet cardboard hot and cold side its pretty crazy 

youll have any kind of service that makes sense to be in the cloud but stuff is super sensitive you dont want in the cloud - you kinda dont want that getting out into the cloud

and it gets complicated when youre troubleshooting as well because we use a lot of NATTING so i work with IP everything i do is ip, i do work with DHCP/DNS too but really all the network stuff 

in one of our private subnets 10.something.something i dont know where that physically is so i need to figure it out and figure out if its behind a nat - you need to basically see where everything is goinga lot of the time youll be working on a ticket but you wont have to information you need - 

will cisco help with jnr role? it depends where you go if you do comp sci you can probably jump into a jnr or mid role without industry certs theyll certify you as soon as you start the role

ITIL helps you understand (v4 current) thats the structure of how an it network should worksimilar to the OSI stack which is a process, OSI is the tech suspective, ITIL is how it works from a process side of things, youll learn a lot if you start as a jnr in a MSP

if youre a programmer theres way less to cert youre just self teaching and keeping up to date unless youre a manager you dont have to try too hard

everything is programnmiung now even in my role we do scripting and automation for easy tasks and you need to use tools / etc and if you wanna do any kinda automation with ticketing CMDB you wanna be able to write something that can query the output you wanna get back you dont have to know everything if you wanna automate the stuff otherwise itl be very manual 

at the moment scripting so i use EXPECT scripts, BASH learn how to use UNIX / VIM but if i had to pick python and JSON
