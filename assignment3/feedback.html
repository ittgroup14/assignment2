<h1>Group Feedback</h1>
<h2>Anthony Brown</h2>
<h3>What went well?</h3>
<p>Again, the group was focused on make the project happen and worked to that  end. The group was decisive and sharing their opinions respectfully. </p>
<h3>What could be improved? </h3>
<p>I found our communications did not run smoothly. It took a while for people  to respond at some points in the project. But fortunately, we were able to  easily get past these times.</p>
<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
<p>I was surprised by resilience of the group. All the individuals kept coming  back and getting on with the job, even after they had difficulties in their  personal lives that might hold them back.</p>
<h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h3>
<p>It is hard to maintain contact with all the people in a group. </p>
<h2>Tim Damon</h2>
<h3>What went well?</h3>
<p>We continued using the existing platforms  (Slack, Trello, Discord and GitHub) that we used in assignment 2 as they worked  very effectively. The GitHub repo was well organised making everything easy to  locate when they needed to be worked on. A clear list of tasks was made  available on the Trello board allowing everyone to know what needed to be done.</p>
<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
<p>Tasks assigned could be completed more quickly (myself included). More  consistent group chats (through Discord) as we only got together a few times  and it was never able to be all of us at once.</p>
<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
<p>How easy it was to organise everything with each person in the group without  ever getting to meet face to face. Trello made creating a list of tasks and  assigning them incredibly easy and the list was always available so it was  always possible to check which tasks needed completing.</p>
<h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>
<p>That each individual putting in effort helps to lighten everyone's work load  and that organisation is key, effective organisation can turn a large task into  something much more manageable.</p>
<h2>Shaun Lottey </h2>
<h3>What went well?</h3>
<p>I feel that all members of group were well organised and great  communicators. Thanks to tools provided by different members such as Trello, we  were able to quickly and effectively organise what seemed a colossal task into  a much more manageable agenda. Group cohesion was almost effortless when  assigning tasks or implementing ideas.</p>
<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
<p>Due to the timing of the year with Christmas, it was difficult for us all to  remain in constant contact throughout. A more regimented communication  schedule, like a set few times each week to catch up would be beneficial to us,  although this is difficult with conflicting work schedules.</p>
<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
<p>Honestly, how easily the group worked together. Each task was put before us,  assigned and completed with people asking for help if they needed it, and help  being given in kind. For the limited times we were all able to speak live it  was an outright pleasant experience.</p>
<h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h3>
<p>Team work makes the dream work. Knowing you have the support of your peers  makes daunting challenges a lot more manageable.</p>
<h2>Jake McAndrew </h2>
<h3>What went well?</h3>
<p>One again, I feel like the team worked  very well together and achieved all goals that were set. The communication in  the group was strong and everyone was easy to talk to.</p>
<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
<p>Similar to assignment 2, I feel like the  only thing that could be improved is to do with myself, being more involved in  communication is something I want to work on. </p>
<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
<p>How well the group worked together and how  friendly everyone was. The final product turned out really well and I think  everyone did an amazing job</p>
<h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>
<p>Assignments are a lot more challenging but  rewarding when done in a group.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;Jason Tilgner </h2>
<h3>What went well?</h3>
<p>The team had some good organisation every was keen to get into the  assignment. Everyone played a big part in getting the presentation video and  prototype done.</p>
<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
<p>Just a bit of hesitation at the start to get tasks started and probably not  leaving things to the last minutes, and also communication.</p>
<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
<p>The skills of the members with the  prototype game and also the effort that went into making it, there was a lot of  background work done by the members. Also how everyone did the input on the  video despite not really liking doing it.<br>
  At least one thing that you have  learned about groups?<br>
  That being organised at the start helps and that having helpful + willing team  mates makes everything a lot smoother. The skill of the other team members. </p>
<h2>Jason Walstab </h2>
<h3>What went well?</h3>
<p>Making the prototype and the general teamwork of putting it altogether went  extremely well, as there were many different moving parts and it was difficult  for us to manage it all. The report was also difficult to write however we  managed to get it altogether on time, which was a great achievement, I think.</p>
<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
<p>Following plans laid out and not deviating to much from what we set out to  achieve. Over the project we had to decide and change and work together on many  small things which sometimes made this rather difficult.</p>
<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
<p>The coming together of the presentation video was quite good as I was  worried about this side of the project. I was very surprised as the quality and  hard work put into the video presentation and happy with how it turned out in  the end.</p>
<h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h3>
<p>I have learned that working in groups is a difficult but rewarding task and  that to ensure good quality work a team must work together to achieve their  goals. This alongside organisation and good communication being a key part of  group work.</p>
