<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<h2>Current Build  Status</h2>
<p>Our build project build is in constant  change. The link below will provide that current release.</p>

<h2>Topic</h2>
<p>The project is to create a flashcard system for  teaching basic English nouns to children whose primary language is not English. <br>
  A flashcard is a combination of an image of an  object with its name and a sound file demonstrating how the word is pronounced.  The software will teach basic English nouns to children using a flashcard  system. It will have mini games to keep the children interested and engaged  through the process. Users will be able to customise the app by adding their  own flashcards.  The customisation will  empower the end-user to improve the app for use in ways that fit their ESL  curriculum. <br>
  We intend on building a small, focused  application that provides a simple tool to help with this specific part of  language acquisition. The product will be available as a standalone website and  on app stores.  We also hope to make the  software offline functional to enable use by remote communities who don&rsquo;t have  high-end technology or qualified teachers to teach English. </p>
<h2>Motivation </h2>
<p>People worldwide consider English to be the most  valuable language to learn as a second language (Taylor, 2020). Research has  predicted that the market for learning English as a second language (ESL) will grow 7.1% and is expecting to hit the $54.8  billion mark by 2025 (Research, 2020). Our motivation is to tap into this  growing market and help children learn some English in areas of the world that  do not have access to native English speakers to teach them. Vietnam, for  example, where there is a documented lack of English teachers available to meet  the demand (News 2020). <br>
  Completing this project would show that our team  was able to work together to produce a viable product. It would demonstrate  that we could identify a need and craft a solution that fits within it. We  consider success to be a high adoption rate. If successful, our project will an  example of us using our skills to help the global community.  </p>
<h2>Landscape<strong></strong></h2>
<p>There are many existing applications in the  market for teaching children second languages, especially English, as it is the  most popular second language. A popular ESL flashcard system aimed at ESL kids  is called Lingo Kids (<a href="http://www.lingokids.com/">www.lingokids.com</a>). We see three significant  differences between our application and Lingo Kids, being:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ours can be customised, by  adding new flashcard decks<strong> </strong></li>
  <li>We will allow people to  share their customisations <strong> </strong></li>
  <li>We will also provide our  application one hundred per cent free <strong> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Many of the competitors in this market seek  to generate income from selling in-app advertising. In adopting this strategy,  our competitors inherently geared towards more affluent urban areas that can  access the items advertised. <br>
  For our motivations, market penetration  (numbers uptake) is more important than profitability – our motive is to  demonstrate our IT skills. We hope our strategy of not charging, or including  advertising, will make the application more favourable for kids in rural, less  wealthy areas. Because of this, we are open ourselves to a significant market  segment that other competitors don&rsquo;t value highly.</p>
<h1>Aims and Goals</h1>
<h2>Project Aim </h2>
<h4>1.0          Build  an English as a Second Language flashcard system.</h4>
<p>We aim to develop a basic working ESL flashcard  application that can:</p>
<ol>
  <li>dynamically load flashcards</li>
  <li>Initiate a the basic operation  of cycling through the flashcards </li>
</ol>
<h3>Enhancement Aims</h3>
<h4>1.1.        Add  mini-game – choose the correct card</h4>
<p>The mini-game will make learning with the  flashcards more engaging of children. </p>
<h4>1.2.        Add  mini-game – memory game</h4>
<p>The mini-game will make learning with the  flashcards more engaging of children. </p>
<h4>1.3.        Add  flashcard customisation</h4>
<p>The customisation will allow users to add  new flashcards by combining a word with an image. The user will then be able to  store their new cards in custom decks. </p>
<h4>1.4.        Add  customisation sharing options</h4>
<p>Users will be able to store custom decks on  the cloud. The community of users may search and download any custom decks  where the owner has made them to publicly accessible. We envision forceful  censorship to ensure the appropriateness of the content is maintained.</p>
<h2>Project management aims</h2>
<h4>1.4.        Create  a presentation video</h4>
<p>The video will outline what the project is  and why it is worthwhile to build. Our marketing video will showcase our  software to people who would be interested in it (I.e. schools, parents,  teachers or education companies).</p>
<h4>1.5.        Create  a web site for the project</h4>
<p>The web site will act as an access point  for the project and expand as the project matures. The site will be an access  point where people can download the software and extra flashcard sets. People  may also view documentation or marketing material related to the product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goals To achieve project aim 1.0</h2>
<h4>1.0.1 Outline the core functionality of the application </h4>
<p>List the core functions the application  will provide.</p>
<h4>1.0.2 Draft a menu workflow </h4>
<p>Decide how the app will flow between  functions and draw up a menu structure that will enable this.</p>
<h4>1.0.3 Create a workable main menu and .exe package</h4>
<p>This goal would be to create a working main  menu prototype for our ESL flashcard software that will run on a Windows  operating system from an executable file. </p>
<h5>1.0.3.1 tested menu  functionality</h5>
<h5>1.0.3.2 test user experience  (UX) to ensure the GUI menu is clear and easy to navigate </h5>
<h5>1.0.3.3 document menu </h5>
<h5>1.0.3.4 add a background image </h5>
<h5>1.0.3.5 add some background  music.</h5>
<h4>1.0.4 Create a basic set of twenty flashcards image files.</h4>
<p>This goal would require us to source  royalty-free images or create our own. The goal would be to have at least  twenty of these to showcase the software. Match the images files to the English  noun.</p>
<h5>1.0.5 Create a matching set of audio recordings for the  images.</h5>
<p>The goal here would be to have an audio  recording for each flashcard image file we have (demonstrating the  pronunciation). The audio recordings are to be brief, clearly spoken and match  the English noun for the flashcard.</p>
<h5>1.0.4.1 test the audio files  satisfy the criteria (outlined above)</h5>
<h5>1.0.4.2 test images, audio and  word (noun) match, and are comprehensible to the target audience</h5>
<h4>1.0.6 Create a dynamic flashcard loading system.</h4>
<p>The application will have a dynamic  flashcard loading system that uses the files stored in the flashcards folder.  The app will cycle through the folder files and compile them into flashcards.  The flashcards will be grouped into decks and arranged within that deck in a  defined order.  No matter how many cards  are in the folder, the software would need to be able to add them dynamically.  This feature would also need to be tested for bugs and usability as well as  having an easy to access </p>
<h5>1.0.6.1 document possible  errors and how they will be handling </h5>
<h5>1.0.6.1 test - the flashcards  components are matched correctly </h5>
<h5>1.0.6.2 test - that the app  handles missing components in an appropriate way </h5>
<h5>1.0.6.3 test - UX that the app  reports missing components to the user clearly </h5>
<h5>1.0.6.3 test – 0, 1 or 1000  flashcards do not cause app failure </h5>
<h4>1.0.7 Create the game-play engine</h4>
<p>Upon the selection of the appropriate menu item,  The application starts the game mode. Once entered the game will run as  documented. The app will exit the game-mode upon request and return to the home  screen. </p>
<h5>1.0.7.1 write the engine </h5>
<h5>1.0.6.1 test – the app  initiates the game correctly</h5>
<h5>1.0.7.2 app exit the game  correctly </h5>
<h5>1.0.6.2 the game runs as  documented </h5>
<h5>1.0.6.3 test - UX that the game  fits the screen correctly and the target clients can operate the controls </h5>
<h2>Goals To achieve project enhancements</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1.1.1 Create a working mini-game (Choose the correct  card).</h4>
<p>Our goal here would be to create a single  mini game that is working and tested. The first mini game to create would be  the &lsquo;choose the correct card&rsquo; game. The specifications for this game are  detailed later in this document.</p>
<h5>1.1.1.1 review specifications  and write a list of achievable goals</h5>
<h5>1.1.1.2 implement the goals</h5>
<h4>1.2.1 Create a second working mini-game (Memory).</h4>
<p>Our goal here would be to create a second  mini game that is working and tested. The second mini game to create would be  the &lsquo;memory&rsquo; game. The specifications for this game are detailed later in this  document.</p>
<h5>1.2.1.1 review specifications  and write a list of achievable goals</h5>
<h5>1.2.1.2 implement the goals</h5>
<h4>1.3.1     Add  flashcard customisation</h4>
<p>The goal is to allow users to add new  cards, and store them into decks</p>
<h5>1.3.1.1 develop a workflow for  importing the required components from the client</h5>
<h5>1.3.1.2 implement the workflow</h5>
<h5>1.3.1.3 test the implementation</h5>
<h4>1.4.1     Add  customisation sharing options</h4>
<p>The goal is to have a method where the  clients can load their customisations to the cloud, where other clients can  download and use the new flashcards.</p>
<h5>1.3.1.1 develop a security and  appropriateness strategy </h5>
<h5>1.3.1.2 develop a workflow for  cloud storage </h5>
<h5>1.3.1.3 implement the workflow</h5>
<h5>1.3.1.3 test the implementation</h5>
<p>Possible future functionality <br>
  -The addition of a  language selection when opening the game so that the games menu&rsquo;s will be  displayed in a language the user knows rather than one they are learning, to  make navigation easier for those learning English.<br>
  -The addition of a  2nd language selection option (possibly a menu option or a pop-up on  game open) to select the language which the user wishes to learn, allowing this  game to useful in learning multiple languages not just as a tool for ESL. Would  require additional assets to be created for each language included.<br>
  -A score tracking  system for each game so that users may be able to see how they are improving  with learning English (or other language). Allow the user to enter their name  and save their score at the end of each round, and display their recent or high  scores afterwards. Could also create a menu option within the main menu to  display previous scores without having to play the a game. </p>
