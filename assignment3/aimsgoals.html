<h1>Team Profile</h1>
<h3>Team Summary</h3>
<p>The Red Panthers team is dominantly  analytical types who are endowed with intellectual gifts, but lacking the  innate skills for keeping a team glued together. However, we have a couple of  characters with natural gifts in leadership and communication. These fill the  void and present a real opportunity for a group of individuals to come together  and achieve goals. <br>
  The functional quirkiness of this group  shows through in all the tests the group has undertaken but best illustrated by  a comparison of the Myers Briggs results. The discussion below focuses on the  Myers Briggs, as any insight from the other tests is hard to articulate (mostly  because they are all different tests) and doesn&rsquo;t offer any greater insight  than the Myers Briggs alone.<br>
  The table below illustrates the tests  undertaken by the Red Panthers </p>

  Current Job: Home dad<br>
  Quick Bio: <br>
  My name is Anthony. I am one of the Red  Panthers. <br>
  My interest in IT started when I was doing  data analysis for my work with Parks and Wildlife. I found solutions to both  research questions and business administration were best provided by IT  knowledge. I have pursued my career and continued to find IT as the solution to  the problem my managers asked me to solve. Over time, almost as if by accident,  I have collected a gaggle of hardly related IT skills and knowledge.  Study at RMIT is a way for me to bring these  together and – hopefully – raise myself up to a better level.</p>

  Education: Certificate IV in information  technology<br>
  Current Job: IT Support Officer / Desktop  Support<br>
  Quick Bio: My Name is Jason, and I am in a  team with the red panthers. I live just outside of a country town called  Yallourn North with my family and cat called tyrion. I have been working in a  few different IT positions over the last 10 years, and have also got a couple  of different IT certificates. I am doing this course as I enjoy IT and also  wish to progress my current career into software development or project  management. My main hobby is I like to gym. <br>
  I have been working on a couple different  IT service desks over the last few years, this includes application support and  also general generic support. When I am not working in IT in my professional  life, I also enjoy gaming and playing with people from all over the world in  different MMO&rsquo;s.</p>

  Hometown:  Sydney<br>
  Education:  Year 12<br>
  Current  Job: Store man at Kmart<br>
  IT  Skills/interest: Java, Cyber security</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name is Jake McAndrew, I&rsquo;m 22 years old and  have lived in Sydney all my life, but plan to someday move to Melbourne to  explore new opportunities. I currently live at home with my parents and my twin  brother who has very different interests to me and is pursuing a career in the  military. I also have a sister who lives in Queensland who is a recently  graduated medical doctor. I was born in Australia, but my family originally  comes from Ireland and Scotland. Currently I can only speak English, but I  would love to one day learn a new language, possibly Gaelic. Recently I started  coding in java and loved it so much that I decided to make it my career, I now  spend most of my free time coding to hone my skills. I have always been very  passionate about all aspects of IT/Computer Science, but I&rsquo;ve always had a  particular interest in cyber security. I plan to use this degree as a launching  pad into a computer science degree specializing in cyber security in the not  too distant future. I like to spend most of my free time playing video games,  coding in java, building computers, making music and lifting weights. I am  currently a full-time employee at Kmart and have been for a number of years. I  hope one day to leave my current job and obtain my dream career working as a  cyber security expert.</p>

  Education: TAFE NSW Certificate IV in Networking <br>
  Current Job: Small business owner (<a href="http://www.quantumdata.com.au/">www.quantumdata.com.au</a>) <br>
  Quick Bio: <br>
  My name is Jason but I usually go by Jay, and I  am on the Red Panthers team. I live in the &ldquo;small&rdquo;, quiet city of NanJing  (population around 11.5 million) in China, with my wife and son and have done  for the last decade or so. <br>
  I have always had a great interest in IT, and I  have been working in the industry since I was 18. I started off in helpdesk,  moved to sys admin and then on to work on CT machines (Philips Brightview XCT  systems) and finally started my own IoT company here in China. I have made IT  my life and will continue to follow that path, hoping this degree will help  along the way. <br>
  I have worked with many different IT  technologies, but now I mainly focus on NodeJS, ESP-32 micro-controllers and  Linux cloud server management. I hope to one day return to Australia and get a  full-time job in programming one day so I can spend more time with my family. <br>
  I have many hobbies which are electronics,  programming, surfing, motor bikes the gym and recently have been getting into  digital art as well as game design. I have spent many years learning language  and now speak mandarin Chinese at a fluent (enough) level, maybe at the expense  of my English though...! I spend most of my free-time spending time with my son  and wife and going out with friends and have a comfortable but busy life here. <br>

  Quick Bio: <br>
  My name is Shaun and I am one of the Red  Panthers. I have had an interest in IT since a very young age. While I hold no  formal qualifications nor have, I ever worked in the industry sector I have  been tinkering with hardware and software since I was 5, starting with an  (ancient by todays comparisons) Commodore 64. <br>
  In primary and high school, my friends and  I would enjoy collecting second hand hardware components such as used server  racks or PCs that our school had scheduled to be decommissioned and rebuilding  them to our purposes. <br>
  From the ages of about 10 onwards, I began  to experiment with programming using utilities such as RPGMaker or making  custom mods for popular FPS titles such as Half-Life. I also learned a lot back  then about HTML, PHP &amp; SQL using it to develop and maintain online forums. <br>
  I also play guitar and enjoy playing online  games with my friends, who are from all over the world.</p>
<p> Name:  Tim Damon<br>
  Student Number:  S3829497<br>
  Home Town:  Wonthaggi, Vic<br>
  Education: Year 12  (2013), Cert III in Retail and Hospitality (5 units of each), Test and Tag  Cert.<br>
  Bio: I Developed  an interest in IT at a young age through video games and expanded my interest  through using various types of computers and discovering what they can do.<br>
  Recently was able  to build my first PC after being interested in doing it for so long, this  sparked a further interest in the more &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; workings  of IT.<br>
  My IT experience  is limited mostly to fixing minor issues for family and friends, but also includes  imaging 1000+ laptops with Windows for a local high school so that they could  be used by the students.<br>
  My hobbies mostly  include playing (and collecting) Video Games with my friends, browsing the  internet (watching videos or reading interesting articles) and watching movies  and TV shows.</p>

<h2>Group Processes</h2>
<p>We received some constructive feedback from  assignment 2. The group has decided not to change the how we are organising the  project. We will continue to use the same online tools meet-up and track our  progress. We consider, despite the pressure individuals were under for our  studies and our normal everyday lives, that we managed to get to our deadlines  on time. Any failings in assignment 2 could not reasonable be blamed on the  tools, but rather our circumstances. We will stay on our path and hope the experience  will leave us better placed to complete assignment 3.</p>
<p>One big change will be making sure we make  all our weekly voice meetings on discord, that we hold every Monday along with  trying to keep more constant communication during the work week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br clear="all">
<h2>Comparing Career Plans</h2>
<p>Jason Walstab would like to pursue a career  as an IoT Solutions Leader. He is undaunted by the esoteric nature of his  career preference. His background gives him insight into the sector, and he  feels there is a big future for IoT technology, and he wants to be a part of  it. <br>
  No-one else in the Red Panthers wants to  work with IoT. But, like Jason, the jobs data has not changed any of our career  ambitions. What we all realised is that our ambitions are aspirations.  Something each of use was working towards. We agreed that we will have to work  our way towards these aspirations. It will not happen in a single step. We all  see ourselves at the bottom of a mountain. WE are aiming for different peaks,  but we might share similar roles along the path to our aspirational goal.<br>
  Anthony and Jason Tilgner both aim towards  full stack developers. Both see a multitude, and varied, paths to this end.  Both also agree that whatever path you take, communication skills: writing and  interpersonal are important. <br>
  Tim and Shaun are committed to becoming  game developers. Both are realistic to the difficulties in this field but are  pragmatic about it. They will pursue a general coding profession with the hope  that they can transition into this field later in their careers. Or, develop  this interest as a side- hassle. <br>
  Jake wants to pursue a career in  cybersecurity. This is his passion. He is discouraged by the low number of jobs  in the area, but he, like Jason Walstab, see a future that is big, and which he  wants to be a part. Jake&rsquo;s endpoint is focused, but like the rest of use. He  will pursue a general coding career while looking for openings in his preferred  field.<br>
WE see IT professional work can be divided  into two parts. Technical skills, and the general getting-things-done-skills.  Wherever you might work, you are developing talents in the later, and  specialised skills in the former. In order to progress towards our specific  roles, we may have to study on the side to develop the required skills, if our  current role does not. But, any role in IT will build the  getting-things-done-skills. You just need to be in a job to get these. And, you  take them with you wherever you might go.</p>
