<h1>Group processes and communications</h1>
<p>Our group has decided on three main methods  of communication, those being:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slack</li>
  <li>Discord</li>
  <li>Trello</li>
  <li>GitHub</li>
</ul>
<p>Slack is what we use primarily for basic  organisation, image sharing and text communication. This is at the heart of our  group's communication methods. We always make sure to stay online on slack and  even though we are in different time zones this has been a great way to focus  our efforts and communications.<br>
  Once  a week on Monday night we have a Discord voice chat meeting, to discuss issues  and plan for the next week in advance. This is good to help us touch base and  make sure everyone is on the same page, most meetings so far have been a  success despite people's busy schedules.<br>
  Trello is what we use as our main planning  board as well as keeping a list of checked jobs and to make sure everything is  on track and planned for. We have a good system of marking job cards as  &lsquo;underway&rsquo; and &lsquo;done to make sure no one is doubling up on tasks.<br>
  GitHub is how we are sharing and collaborating  on documents that we need to produce. In the end this was used less for  collaboration and more used in the final stages of compiling to ensure our  project can be compiled and put together with ease and in an organised manner.</p>
