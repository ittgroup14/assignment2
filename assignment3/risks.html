<h1>Risks</h1>
<h2>Scope too large</h2>
<p>There is a risk that the scope of the project  is too large for us to manage. While we will diligently try to pursue this task  of creating an ESL flashcard system, the project might be too big, and we will  not be able to finish or meet time constraints for our project. We should try  to minimise this risk by sticking to and meeting deadlines as well as following  a well-organised structure that will come from good project planning and not  procrastinating on tasks we individually need to complete.</p>
<h2>Programming issues</h2>
<p>The programming skills for the collective  group will not be enough to complete the project. <br>
  We may not have the expertise to complete  essential components, such as the dynamic flashcard loading system. This case  would be a critical failure, as we could not then achieve any of the functionality  that relies on the essential component. <br>
  We may not have the expertise to complete  additional features. Once we have completed the core functionality, we may find  we cannot complete the enhancements we have documented. This case would be less  critical, but the impact on the overall value of the final product may be  substantial.</p>
<h2>Application Quality</h2>
<p>The end product may not be of high enough  quality to be palatable to potential clients. We may complete a functional app  by following our plan and meeting the technical and logistical challenges but  have a product that is unfavourable to the potential clients. If the final  product does not present well and is easy to use, then it will face poor  take-up rates with clients.</p>
<h2>Market Saturation</h2>
<p>We may not get a good take-up rate in the  marketplace because of the number of competing applications. The market for ESL  learning tools is already quite large. Although we envision a target section  within the market, our app may fail to be recognised. </p>
<h2>Reaching the end-users</h2>
<p>Our application may not reach the intended  users. Our intended users will primarily be non-native English speakers living  in remote locations in foreign countries. We can devise an advertising  strategy, but it is a complex market segment to target. Our advertising  approach may not work.</p>
<h2>Too difficult to use</h2>
<p>Our application may not be useful to the  end user because it is not easy to use. We may find the app intuitive, but our  clients are different from us and they might not feel the same way.</p>
<h2>System requirements too high</h2>
<p>Our app will not be able to be run on  systems our clients currently have. Our application is primarily for people in  areas that lack modern technology and they may be running technology  generations behind ours.Â  We might find  we are accessing technologies that their systems cannot support.</p>
