    <h3>Anthony Brown</h3>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Anthony Brown<br>
      <strong>Student Number:</strong> S3460996<br>
      <strong>Hometown:</strong> Caloundra, Australia<br>
      <strong>Education:</strong> University of Queensland, BA applied  Science<br>
      <strong>Current Job:</strong> Home dad<br>
      <strong>Quick Bio: </strong><br>
      My name is Anthony. I am one of the Red Panthers. <br>
      My interest in IT started when I was doing data analysis for  my work with Parks and Wildlife. I found solutions to both research questions  and business administration were best provided by IT knowledge. I have pursued  my career and continued to find IT as the solution to the problem my managers  asked me to solve. Over time, almost as if by accident, I have collected a  gaggle of hardly related IT skills and knowledge.  Study at RMIT is a way for me to bring these  together and – hopefully – raise myself up to a better level.</p>
    <h3><a name="_Hlk29307190">Timothy Damon</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Timothy Damon<br>
      <strong>Student Number:</strong> S3829497<br>
      <strong>Hometown:</strong> Wonthaggi, Vic<br>
      <strong>Education</strong>: Year 12 (2013), Cert III in Retail and  Hospitality (5 units of each), Test and Tag Cert.<br>
      <strong>Quick Bio: </strong><br>
      I Developed an interest in IT at a young age through video  games and expanded my interest through using various types of computers and  discovering what they can do.<br>
      Recently was able to build my first PC after being  interested in doing it for so long, this sparked a further interest in the more  &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; workings of IT.<br>
      My IT experience is limited mostly to fixing minor issues  for family and friends, but also includes imaging 1000+ laptops with Windows  for a local high school so that they could be used by the students.<br>
      My hobbies mostly include playing (and collecting) Video  Games with my friends, browsing the internet (watching videos or reading  interesting articles) and watching movies and TV shows.</p>
    <h3>Shaun Lottey</h3>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Shaun Lottey<br>
      <strong>Student Number:</strong> S3829826<br>
      <strong>Hometown:</strong> Sydney, Australia<br>
      <strong>Education: </strong>Trinity Catholic College, Class of 2007<br>
      <strong>Current Job:</strong> Driver/Storeperson<br>
      <strong>Quick Bio: </strong><br>
      My name is Shaun and I am one of the Red Panthers. <br>
      I have had an interest in IT since a very young age. While I  hold no formal qualifications nor have, I ever worked in the industry sector I  have been tinkering with hardware and software since I was 5, starting with an  (ancient by todays comparisons) Commodore 64. <br>
      In primary and high school, my friends and I would enjoy  collecting second hand hardware components such as used server racks or PCs  that our school had scheduled to be decommissioned and rebuilding them to our  purposes. </p>
    <p>From the ages of about 10 onwards, I began to experiment  with programming using utilities such as RPGMaker or making custom mods for  popular FPS titles such as Half-Life. I also learned a lot back then about  HTML, PHP &amp; SQL using it to develop and maintain online forums. <br>
      I also play guitar and enjoy playing online games with my  friends, who are from all over the world.</p>

    <h3>Jake McAndrew</h3>
    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Jake McAndrew<br>
      <strong>Student number:</strong> S3818850<br>
      <strong>Hometown:</strong> Sydney<br>
      <strong>Education:</strong> Year 12<br>
      <strong>Current Job:</strong> Store man at Kmart<br>
      <strong>IT Skills/interest:</strong> Java, Cyber security<br>
      <strong>Quick Bio: </strong><br>
      My name is Jake McAndrew, I&rsquo;m 22 years old and have lived in  Sydney all my life, but plan to someday move to Melbourne to explore new  opportunities. I currently live at home with my parents and my twin brother who  has very different interests to me and is pursuing a career in the military. I  also have a sister who lives in Queensland who is a recently graduated medical  doctor. I was born in Australia, but my family originally comes from Ireland  and Scotland. Currently I can only speak English, but I would love to one day  learn a new language, possibly Gaelic. Recently I started coding in java and  loved it so much that I decided to make it my career, I now spend most of my  free time coding to hone my skills. I have always been very passionate about  all aspects of IT/Computer Science, but I&rsquo;ve always had a particular interest  in cyber security. </p>
    <p>I plan to use this degree as a launching pad into a computer  science degree specializing in cyber security in the not too distant future. I  like to spend most of my free time playing video games, coding in java,  building computers, making music and lifting weights. I am currently a  full-time employee at Kmart and have been for a number of years. I hope one day  to leave my current job and obtain my dream career working as a cyber security  expert.</p>
    <h3>Jason Tilgner</h3>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Jason Tilgner<br>
      <strong>Student Number:</strong> S3830312<br>
      <strong>Hometown: </strong>Yallourn North<br>
      <strong>Education: </strong>TAFE Certificates<br>
      <strong>Quick Bio: </strong><br>
      Hi my name is Jason Tilgner, I am one of the Red Panthers.  <br>
      My RMIT student number is S3830312. I live just outside of a  country town called Yallourn North with my family and cat called Tyrion. I have  been working in a few different IT positions over the last 10 years and have  also got a couple of different IT certificates. I am doing this course as I  enjoy IT and also wish to progress my current career into software development  or project management. My main hobby is I like to gym and also go to cross fit. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Jason Walstab</h3>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Jason Walstab<br>
      <strong>Student Number:</strong> S3291269<br>
      <strong>Hometown: </strong>Central Coast, Australia<br>
      <strong>Education: </strong>TAFE NSW Certificate IV in Networking<br>
      <strong>Current Job:</strong> Small business owner  (www.quantumdata.com.au)<br>
      <strong>Quick Bio: </strong><br>
      My name is Jason, but I usually go by Jay, and I am on the  Red Panthers team. </p>
    <p>I live in the &ldquo;small&rdquo;, quiet city of NanJing (population  around 11.5 million) in China, with my wife and son and have done for the last  decade or so. <br>
      I have always had a great interest in IT, and I have been  working in the industry since I was 18. I started off in helpdesk, moved to sys  admin and then on to work on CT machines (Philips Brightview XCT systems) and  finally started my own IoT company here in China.</p>
    <p>I have made IT my life and  will continue to follow that path, hoping this degree will help along the way.<br>
      I have worked with many different IT technologies, but now I  mainly focus on NodeJS, ESP-32 micro-controllers and Linux cloud server  management. I hope to one day return to Australia and get a full-time job in  programming one day so I can spend more time with my family.</p>
    <p><br>
      I have many hobbies which are electronics, programming,  surfing, motor bikes the gym and recently have been getting into digital art as  well as game design. I have spent many years learning language and now speak  mandarin Chinese at a fluent (enough) level, maybe at the expense of my English  though...! I spend most of my free-time spending time with my son and wife and  going out with friends and have a comfortable but busy life here.</p>
    <h2>Team Profile</h2>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>The Red Panthers team is dominantly analytical types who are  endowed with intellectual gifts but lacking the innate skills for keeping a  team glued together. However, we have a couple of characters with natural gifts  in leadership and communication. These fill the void and present a real  opportunity for a group of individuals to come together and achieve goals. <br>
      The functional quirkiness of this group shows through in all  the tests the group has undertaken but best illustrated by a comparison of the  Myers Briggs results. The discussion below focuses on the Myers Briggs, as any  insight from the other tests is hard to articulate (mostly because they are all  different tests) and doesn&rsquo;t offer any greater insight than the Myers Briggs  alone.<br>
      The table below illustrates the tests undertaken by the Red  Panthers </p>

    <h4>Myers Briggs Comparison</h4>
    <p>The test site 16personalities (link <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types">https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types</a>)  groups Myers Briggs personality types (type) into four groups (role): Analysts,  Diplomates, Sentinels and Explorers. Within each role is four types. Each type  has an emotive name that illustrates the nature of that type. The diagram below  shows the Myers Briggs matrix, and the counts are how the Red Panthers arrange  within this sphere.</p>
    <h6>TABLE: The distribution of Red Panthers within the Myers Brigg Matrix of  Possible results (with roles illustrated) </h6>
    <p>ISTJ        ISFJ        INFJ       INTJ<br>
      ISTP       ISFP       INFP      INTP<br>
      ESTP      ESFP      ENFP     ENTP<br>
      ESTJ       ESFJ       ENFJ      ENTJ<br>
      <em>Analysts</em><br>
      1 Logician<br>
      2  Architect<br>
      1  Debater<br>
      <em>Diplomats</em><br>
      1 Mediator <br>
      1 Protagonist<br>
      <em>Sentinels </em><br>
      <em>Explorers </em></p>
    <p>First off, what is a Protagonist? And, do we even need one  of these? Turns out, yes, Protagonists are natural leaders, which every team  needs. They are tormented souls with a natural empathy that others find  authentic, even charismatic – the building blocks of a great leader. Like in a  novel, one Protagonist is about the right number.</p>
    <p>More obviously, we are a group composed of Analysts and  Diplomates but no Sentinel&rsquo;s or Explorers. The question is; are we a lesser  team for not having Sentinels or Explorers? Explorers are risk-takers that do  their work fast and well, though easily distracted. They seem very useful but  irritating. Sentinels on-the-other-hand are hard-working administrators.  Sentinels are another type any team would benefit from having. In fact, these  two roles together could be a power team in their own right – like Matthew  McConaughey and Kate Hudson in <em>Fools Gold</em>. </p>
    <p>Can we get by without these two amazing personalities  contributing to our cause? A closer look at the types we have should answer  this.  We are strong in analyst, with  three out of four types covered. We also have an additional Diplomat. Alongside  our Protagonist (already discussed) we are doubly blessed to have a Mediator.  Like unicorns, Mediators are rare – and magical. Mediators come loaded with  talents amiable to working in teams: principled, able to genuinely connect with  people and understanding of their place as part of the whole. To be at their  best, a Mediator need to keep their energy levels high, so leadership and  administrative help are vital. </p>
    <p>The core of our group is a cohort of Analytic types – not  surprising for an IT degree. Analysts are excellent strategic thinkers, but not  so good when it comes to social or romantic pursuits. Luckily, we are all  dudes. Jokes aside, the Red Panther is confronted with the inescapable truth;  we have the intellectual horsepower to deal whatever is before us, but our  awkward, prickly selves might be the iceberg to our teamwork titanic. </p>
    <p>A balanced team we are not. We have a severe lean towards  the Analyst pole, with nothing balancing the team from the spontaneous and  neatly arranged Explorer and Sentinel roles. On the bright side, the Red Panther&rsquo;s  edges are more than smoothed out with the serendipitous inclusion of two  enigmatic representatives from the Diplomatic roles. A Protagonist brings  leadership qualities and our Mediator comes with a cornucopia of team-binding  instincts. </p>
    <p>We must stay vigilant to the near and present dangers of not  sticking together as a group. We should let the fundamental skills within take  root. Achieve this, and we can be as good as any IT department has ever been.  Although, a Kate Hudson type would be an inclusion worth head-hunting. </p>
    <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
    <p>Our group picked ideal jobs across a few different areas of  information technology, most of the group wishes to eventually end up in the  programming field in different sub areas. Such as gaming programmers or stack  developers. Tim is interested / ideal job is being a senior game player  designer, Shaun has expressed an interest in being a senior C++ engineer / Game  play programmer, Jake&rsquo;s interest is in being a software developer, Jason T has  an interest in being a full stack developer, Anthony&rsquo;s expression of interest  is also in being a full stack developer, and Jason S is interested in being an  IOT (internet of things) solutions team leader</p>
    <p>.As most of the group is interested in software development /  programming some of the skills needed amongst the group are very similar in the  programming job roles. Some of these skills include understanding of  programming languages, level of understanding of using text editors to produce  code, the ability to work well in a small team, and the ability to adapt to new  technology quickly. These skills are the same and needed regardless of the area  of programming our group is wishing to enter. As every programmer needs to  understand the code for the application they are writing, every programmer needs  a tool to produce code, and most programming teams are not overly large. The  common element among our team group is that we want to end up in programming -  even Jason S who wishes to be an IOT solutions team leader, so members of the  group has very similar career pathways. Another common factor among our group  is most of us have a requirement to learn C++.</p>
    <p>While the common theme amongst our group is a career in  programming, we have expressed interests in different areas of programming. Our  diverse interests include games programming, web programming, business  application development and IOT knowledge. The obvious differences in our  chosen jobs is that the platforms you use in one field is not use in another.  For example, you could &lsquo;unity&rsquo;, used for game creation, for building business  applications.  The members of our group  will need to develop skills and knowledge in different platforms, languages and  tools. Another difference is, for the two members who have selected stack  development as their ideal roles, they will need to gain experience with  several tools or languages. This could include Java, C sharp, CSS.</p>
    <p>The group does have a lot of key similarities in our main  areas of programming and in IOT knowledge. But because we are interested in different  fields, there are some differences in the tools and experience required for  each chosen job. This will also help process our group along as we are  interested in the same / similar things.</p>

    <h2>Tools discussion</h2>
    <p>We, the Red Panthers made great use of four main  communications tools: GitHub, Trello, Discord and Slack.<br>
      These tools have really been the backbone for this group and  have allowed us to work as a team regardless of distance or time zones. We  believe that, without these tools the work would not have been possible. We all  feel that what went well was the setting up of these tools from the start to  ensure everyone could follow along and contribute as necessary. This allowed us  to establish as clear workflow structure that we could all follow.<br>
      The contributions started with those most familiar with the  technology. As the project progressed, members that had not used them much  before became most relaxed and began contributing in their own name, instead of  having others lodge on their behalf. This evolution is reflected in the commit  history on GitHub.</p>

    <h3>Consideration of what the Burning Glass list of job titles is presenting</h3>
    <p>The burning Glass data ranked by count of job descriptions  advertised across a year. We see some problems with this data. Once smoothed  out and accounted for the figures reflect a different outcome. We have  explained this below, then looked at how the Red Panthers dreams are reflected  in the job market.</p>
    <h4>Data adjustments</h4>
    <p>In considering this data and our future career aspirations,  we see three issues that must be address:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ranking is misleading</li>
      <li>Job titles have not been compiled into homogeneous  groups</li>
      <li>Salaries are not considered</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We discuss each in turn.</p>
    <h5>Ranking </h5>
    <p>Firstly, the current listing is also overly dramatic. The  difference between counts for some descriptions is inconsequential. Looking at  the graph you might think job A is in more demand than job B because it is one  step higher in the rank, but this isn&rsquo;t so. The difference in counts are  somewhat inconsequential. In other words, a great number of these jobs should  be ranked on the same tier because their counts are more-or-less the same. We  did this by converting the counts to a percentage of the total, then ranking by  base points (first decimal of the percentage).   Ranking cells changed from 200 to 24. See TABLE1.<br>
      Looking at this new arrangement; we see the top 50% of job  counts are within the range of 1%-3%, which is very close to each other. We  wonder, for half the jobs listed, if this ranking is insightful at all. </p>
    <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
    <h5>Join like jobs together </h5>
    <p>The second issue is that job titles have not been well  combined. The job &lsquo;System Architect&rsquo; looks like the most in-demand job, but  below we will disprove this. <br>
      We searched for job titles that contained the word &lsquo;desk&rsquo;  and found a mass of related roles. The different job names reflect more the  changing trends in job titles, less the change in job role.  A count of 16 job titles was returned with a  sum of 2000 ads, making this by far the most prolific job placements at 6% of  the total. The job descriptions also give us hope that there is a considerable  opportunity for career progression within this bracket.  See TABLE 1a.<br>
      Similarly, front-end developer positions look small, but  after accounting for variations in naming the count becomes healthy. Together,  jobs containing the term &lsquo;front&rsquo; sum to 1197 job placements. At 4% of the  total, a substantial lead on &lsquo;Systems Architects&rsquo;. See TABLE 1b.</p>
    <h5>Salary </h5>
    <p>The other thing entirely missing from this approach is  salary. There may have only been 50 IT Security Analyst listed in the last  year, but say their salary is $250K annually, you might well want to have you  sights on this, in the long run. You cannot get to these big paying jobs in  quick steps, you must build a career towards them. But what are they? </p>
    <h3>Looking at Jobs Titles within Red Panther</h3>
    <p>Within our group, there are four types of jobs we are interested  in pursuing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full-stack developer</li>
      <li>C++ Engineer (Gameplay Programmer)</li>
      <li>Cyber-security</li>
      <li>IoT engineer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Full-stack developers should have developed skills in front  end and back end frameworks. We accumulated a list of front-end, back end,  cloud and database type roles that are encompassed by the term &lsquo;full-stack&rsquo;.  The total is 2750 job adds. At 9% of all listings, this is a healthy line of  business. See Table 2.<br>
      General variants on the developer theme, and outside of  those already counted, totalled 6030 jobs (around 20%) Table 3.<br>
      Gameplay and C+ engineers have few listings. There are no  Game developers and only 90 C language positions.<br>
      Cyber-security. Looking for jobs containing &lsquo;security&rsquo;  returns a list of 900 jobs. At 3% of the total, this too is a big hitter, and  with options for career progression - Table 4.<br>
      The is nothing in the list for IoT engineer, making it a  boutique line of work.</p>

    <h2>Reconsidered Job Interests</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Anthony Brown           Full-Stack  Developer</h3>
    <p>I think a full-stack developer covers a broad range of  skills that can generate a lot of opportunities in an IT career. I am happy to  continue in this direction, as opportunities arise.</p>
    <h3>Tim Damon     Senior Gameplay Designer</h3>
    <p>As someone starting this course without a specific job goal  post, more using the course to see which aspects of IT interest me, my ideal  job was less of a goal and more of an interesting point that one of several  paths could lead me too. As such my ideal job is not set in stone and is  subject to constant change depending on which aspects I am finding most  interesting. But an ideal job to me would be one that fits my interests, not  one that appears to be most available; though it could happen that both end up  true.</p>
    <h3>Shaun Lottey   Senior C++ Engineer  (Gameplay Programmer)</h3>
    <p>Looking at the data, my ideal job is a saturated market with  few job opportunities available. As I was aware of this beforehand, it has not  much changed my opinion nor my desire to pursue this type of career. Few people  in IT choose the game development route, and even fewer succeed. As this a long  time dream of mine I will still continue to pursue a general programming route,  as it is what I excel at but with the hope it may lead to game-specific work.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Jake McAndrew           ASD Software  Developer/cybersecurity</h3>
    <p>After looking at the data for jobs in the cyber security  field, I feel a little underwhelmed with amount of jobs available. As of now, I  am still very determined to work for the ASD as a Software developer because  cyber security is my main passion when it comes to IT and I feel it would be a  very rewarding career, but it may be harder to achieve then I initially  thought. Looking at the data has also made me consider a fall back career as a  java developer.</p>
    <h3>Jason Tilgner   developer / full stack  developer.</h3>
    <p>After researching further into the field of full stack  developer based on the information stats and skills needed, I would still be  very interested in getting into this field. As I am massively keen to enter  this part of the industry, I am not put off but any additional skills needed  and the below graphics show that there is good job opportunity. Also even sub  stacker rolls. The only thing I would need to consider and become better at is  the nontechnical skills such as communication, learning to work in teams etc.</p>
    <h3>Jason Walstab  IoT Solutions Leader</h3>
    <p>After looking at the data for jobs in the industry, the lack  of specialized IoT jobs is not surprising. It is a relatively new field,  although it is beginning to grow.<br>
      Another factor is that generally IoT jobs are also split  into separate job titles. A network engineer is hired for the network side of  things, a programmer for the programming, hardware engineer for hardware design  etc.<br>
      This field is still a growing field and although the job  market now doesn't reflect it, I still believe IoT specialist jobs will only  continue to rise as the industry matures and I would continue to look at this  career path for the future.</p>

    <h1>IT Work </h1>
    <h2>Interview an IT professional</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>For our teams interview an IT professional, we  conducted a live chat using the Discord platform with Mr Benjamin White, a  senior network engineer who currently works as a MSP or Managed Service  Provider for Transport NSW. Mr White was given a set of questions beforehand  for the main interview and was also nice enough to give some of us Q &amp; A  time prior to finishing up regarding any questions the members of group 14 had  regarding his job, career progression and the IT field in general.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>The type of work done</h3>
    <p>As a senior network engineer, Ben is part of a  team responsible for the design, implementation and management of his clients&rsquo;  networks &amp; infrastructure&rsquo;s hardware and software. He has six people  working directly underneath him while also being on call to major fault events  that may happen from time to time.<br>
      Being response-based and heavily within the  confines of tender based contractual obligations , it is his role to step in  when lower tiers engineers (known as L1 and L2) can&rsquo;t find solutions to their  ticketed problems or when the issue of time and money is of paramount  importance.  <br>
      On the software side, using technologies such  as bash and python, he works hand in hand with both these lower levels but also  simultaneously his own management teams to ensure problems are fixed on time  and on budget. Ben stressed the importance of this when he explained some  contracts can be as much as $100,000 per month in penalties if issues aren&rsquo;t  corrected as soon as possible. <br>
      Ben began as a L1 MSP just five years ago working  on a host of different problem solving issues – things like broken equipment,  bad cabling or routing, user errors, power outages and other general tech  support items for a multitude of clients. After two years he found himself  wanting to concentrate on a single client and so he so he moved up to L2 and  then L3 for Transport NSW in his MSP. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Interactions of the IT  professional</h3>
    <p>Ben works with six direct reports under him  and a plethora of other clients, architects and service living managers. He  also has interactions with his own manager and several account managers whose  role it is to make sure Ben and his teams aren&rsquo;t bleeding money on fixing  things.<br>
      As Transport NSW is a public entity with a  very large public userbase, occasionally he may even have to interact with the  Minister for Transport and their team to prevent or correct issues which have a  real-time real world effect on people using their services such as the buses  and trains – not only to adhere to his obligations but also to prevent any political  backlash on failures to the services his team renders.</p>
    <h3>Where does this IT  professional spend most of their time? </h3>
    <p>He spends most of his time between multiple  locations, the office, client sites as well as a data centre. Work is generally  split between a schedule of two days remote work and three days working  on-site, although can vary with over-time and in emergency situations such as  large network outages.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>What aspect of their position  is most challenging? </h3>
    <p>Most challenging part of the position was  dealing with clients and working under pressure. He told of us a time when the  train systems scheduling computers on the platforms were down and having issues  and even the NSW transport minister was involved due to the possible political  ramifications of this. Another challenging situation was when there was large  network outages affecting a data centre, and he had to solve the problem under  the watchful eyes of clients and outside contractors.</p>

    <h1>IT Technologies </h1>
    <h2>Topic 1: small computing devices</h2>
    <h3>What do small computing devices do:</h3>
    <p>Small single-board devices like a Raspberry Pi,  an Arduino or an ESP-32 are generally used in many applications. You will find  them in appliances, factories, home-automation, network security, healthcare,  robotics, education, hardware/invention prototyping and IoT applications. They  can be used as regular computers but more often as controllers for electrical  devices (everything from light bulbs, factory robotics, fridges to large  commercial hot water systems). Generally, the use of one of these pieces of  hardware would be to run a small script or program on the micro-computer, with  its GPIO pins connected to whatever device and/or devices you would wish to  control. <br>
      What these computing devices do is allow someone  to use them as a computer to control the electrical signals sent to the GPIO  pins. They have inputs/outputs to connect to sensors and information  receive/send functions. The driving technological force behind these  single-board computers has been the constant technological advancements in  manufacture of smaller, more efficient, less costly computer parts.  Specifically, smaller storage, CPU and ram.<br>
      An example of what a micro- computer would do in  a home automation setup would be having a Raspberry Pi with a movement  detector. The detector (or an ultrasonic distance detector) could see if  someone or something is moving in view of the sensor. If movement is detected,  a camera installed on the Pi can automatically begin recording. The video can  be stored locally or remotely on a cloud server. A setup like this would not be  expensive compared to the previous generation of commercial security camera  setups. They required expensive DVR equipment and a central server to store  video data.<br>
      Another example is to use micro-computer to  report productivity in a factory. the ESP-32 micro-computer could be connected  to a PLC control-board operating a conveyer belt. The ESP-32 could be  programmed to send instructions to the PLC board using the &lsquo;Modbus&rsquo; computer  language through an open source software such as Node-Red. This ESP-32 could  then be setup to create and send weekly reports of conveyor belt speeds to a  server. The reports would give a rough assessment of productivity during the  week.<br>
      An appliance example is use with a hot water  system. An Arduino could be attached to a temperature sensor within the tank.  The Arduino sends the sensor&rsquo;s internal tank temperature records to a cloud  server. The head company then accumulates statistics on how well their hot  water systems are performing in the field. Using this kind of technology, a  company would be able to detect trends over time and to a degree of accuracy  that has not previously be achievable. Previously they would have sent an  electrician/plumber to check numbers every time a tank is serviced, which is an  additional labour cost avoided.<br>
      A final example is to improve network security by  using a raspberry Pi as a remote VPN. Maybe you are a journalist/government  employee/high corporate going to a foreign country where internet access is  heavily restricted, and you need to send or view sensitive information over the  internet. Before you leave, you could setup a Raspberry Pi at a secure location  in your own country with an Open-VPN server, which you could then connect to  remotely with an Open-VPN client when you have landed at your new location.  This would allow you to have cheap access to a secure stable line that could  not be viewed by a third party, such as a commercial VPN provider.<br>
      What these devices do is up to the person who is  using it, as there are so many different uses and applications and the list is  only growing as the technology matures.</p>
    <h3>What is the likely impact of small computing devices:<a name="_Hlk29326702"></a></h3>
    <p>I believe the likely impact of small single-board computers  will be the computerization of many products that were previously not  computerised or networked. The price point for single-board computers has been  dropping considerably, especially over the last decade. This makes it more  accessible for people to use single-board computers in their product  designs/tech solutions.  <br>
      The impact will especially be felt in the IoT sector, which  is growing at incredible rates. The IoT market is fuelled by the rise of  single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino and is expected to  reach $1,102.6 billion US dollars by the end of 2026  (Fortunebusinessinsights.com, 2020). Due to the huge growth in this sector, we  can expect to see this whole new industry around small single-board computers  become a much bigger deal in the future as well as providing many new jobs,  challenges, solutions and problems. The single-board computer market itself is  expected to reach $1 billion US dollars by the end of 2025 (Global Market  Insights, 2020).<br>
      Another impact will be especially felt in developing  countries where small single-board computers have been at the heart of robotics  development in Kenya, Africa. This has spurred a huge education drive towards  programming, robotics and computers and will be one of the big driving factors  of helping to develop these countries by providing jobs, industry and education  to areas that were previously not able to access and work with high  cutting-edge technology (The Star, 2020), (Fast Company, 2020).<br>
      With these developments in small single-board computing  technology, even the future of national security may be impacted. In April  2018, America&rsquo;s space agency NASA was attacked and comprised via the use of a  $35 Raspberry Pi. As people's homes, workplaces and governments are  increasingly connected and equipped with small single-board computers the risk  of hacking and cyber-attacks may increase and cause many potential problems in  the future (Forbes.com, 2020) , (CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT AT THE  JET PROPULSION LABORATORY, 2019).</p>
    <h3>How will small computing devices will affect people:</h3>
    <p>In daily life, I believe the affect it will have  on me and others will be substantial. The idea of a computer being a large,  bulky and expensive device is no longer a reality for the home consumer. If you  want to watch movies, browse the internet or listen to music you can simply  purchase a cheap single-board computer and plug it into any TV to do the trick.  The rise of this cheap computing revolution will no doubt bring people who were  previously not interested in tech into the fold as it becomes a part of daily  life.<br>
      Privacy concerns will also arise. Small computer  devices are all being networked and presumably connected to the cloud.  People's homes will be more susceptible to  attack through this gateway (WashingtonPost.com, 2020). This could affect  myself directly, or indirectly (via my breach) my friends or family.  With small computer devices, the need to stay  diligent regarding cyber-security will be a necessity of everyday life. The  need for everyday people to understand the basics of network security increases  as these new technologies get implemented.<br>
      For us here studying IT at RMIT, the field of  micro-computers is going to have a great effect on our careers. As people who  are studying IT, or strive to work in an IT field, we should take an interest  in the growing industry of IoT and single-board computers. <br>
      Electronics has been left on the wayside of IT  skills for a long time now. But with the rise of single-board computers, there  will also rise the IT specialists with the electronics skills to build and  service them. A new specialty (or the re-emergence of an old one). Since the  use of single-board computers generally requires a broad knowledge of IT,  combing all aspects of previously separated fields such as hardware/networking/programming  and electronics, this will be especially demanding of a broad knowledge base.</p>

    <h2>Topic 2: Cybersecurity</h2>
    <h3>What does it do:</h3>
    <p>Recently, my Mum&rsquo;s bank account was hacked. The company she  shopped with did not have the right cybersecurity measures to keep her  information safe and secure. My mum&rsquo;s example illustrates how cybersecurity in  a business – or more poignantly the lack of – can have a profound effect on the  average person. <br>
      As our society becomes more and more dependent on computers and  technology, the importance and need for cybersecurity has grown exponentially.  Cybersecurity is such an essential piece of technology as a range of  organisations including government, banks, medical facilities and companies  (small and large) store an incredible amount of information. A significant  portion of that information is extremely sensitive. Our society also has lots  of specialty software and hardware that may not be available anywhere else in  the world. Our dependent on computers and our advanced technology makes us a  target for hackers and cybercriminals.<br>
      The absolute goal of cybersecurity is to prevent or limit  the risk of a possible cyberattack. Cybersecurity must protect sensitive  information from being accessed by unauthorised people, as well as protect  other related vital pieces of IT. Without any form of cybersecurity,  organisations and businesses will be left wide open for potential cyber-threats  and cybercrime. In many countries, it is illegal for a large company to have no  cybersecurity measures due to the large amounts of sensitive information they  hold.<br>
      One of the major new technologies developed for  cybersecurity is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Cognitive computing,  an advanced type of AI, is already being implemented worldwide by many  cybersecurity firms. Cognitive computing uses many different types of AI  technologies, such as machine-learning algorithms and deep learning networks,  to analyse and learn from each threat it detects. This type of AI is an  essential part of modern-day cybersecurity because it allows a better  understanding of advanced threats and also enables a quicker and more decisive  response to them.<br>
      The use of AI in cybersecurity allows IT professionals in  the field to be more efficient. For example,   experts may use AI to detect and gain information about each threat. The  expert can then use the information to respond quickly and more appropriately to  the threat. The AI acts like an advisor, of sorts, to the expert, effectively  making the whole process quicker.<br>
      Technology grows at an extraordinary rate. Likewise, AI in  cybersecurity is only going to become more prominent. In a survey conducted by  the Capgemini Research Institute, 69% of organisations think AI is necessary to  respond to cyber-attacks. And, three out of five firms said that using AI  improves the accuracy and efficiency of cyber-analysts. This research supports  the proposition that over the next few years, cybersecurity firms will continue  implementing new forms of AI.</p>
    <h3>What can be done now:</h3>
    <p>Right now, there are many ways to implement cybersecurity  measures inside an organisation. These include; installing firewalls and  implementation more encryption within the network. Businesses may hire  cybersecurity experts and security analyst to help protect their assets against  threats. Experts may seek and eliminate variabilities through such things as  ethical hacking, or installing tools to monitor for intrusions, or indeed  respond to security incidents. Cybersecurity experts are a vital part of the  industry and any organisations, big or small, who are looking to protect  themselves from cybercrime, should consider enlisting their aid.</p>
    <h3>What is the likely impact:</h3>
    <p>Cybersecurity allows organisations to protect their most  valuable assets. Cyber-crime has a major impact on the world today, and the  cybersecurity industry has created numerous employment opportunities in  response. It is a multibillion-dollar industry with a market value of more than  $120 billion. As we develop more technologies, such as cognitive computing,  hardware authentication and user-behaviour analytics, the market value will  increase. The industry predicts the value of the sector will to grow to $300  billion by 2024. </p>
    <p>Experts have conflicting views on the impacts of AI  technologies on employment in the field. AI technologies have already started  to replace workers in many industries such as healthcare, pharmaceutical  research, retail and marketing. Many experts fear that this could also happen  in the field of cybersecurity. Some disagree. Aaron Levie, chief executive of  cloud storage service &lsquo;Vendor Box&rsquo; once said &ldquo;If you want a job for the next  few years, work in technology. If you want a job for life, work in  cybersecurity&rdquo;. </p>
    <p>Tech enthusiasts and some cybersecurity specialists believe  that advancements in AI for cybersecurity will not remove cybersecurity jobs,  but it will drastically change them. In the not so distant future, we could see  humans and AI working together to complement each other. An example of this  would be AI responding to a malware attack, quickly researching characteristics  of the malware and recommended a course of action. AI relieves the analysts  from any time-consuming manual research. In theory, this will speed the process  of responding to a threat dramatically, then making the analyst&rsquo;s job more  enjoyable.  Experts already working will  have to upgrade their skills to keep pace with these new technologies.</p>
    <h3>How will this affect you</h3>
    <p>A common misconception is that cybersecurity is something  that only big organisations have to worry about. But in reality, cybersecurity  has a profound effect on everyone who connected to the internet. As someone who  likes to be protected when browsing online, these advancements in cybersecurity  bring me peace of mind. We all must trust organisations with our private and  sensitive data. It&rsquo;s of utmost importance that they stay up to date with the  current technologies to keep our information safe</p>
    <p>Even though my family and friends do not know all that much  about cybersecurity, the recent advancements are going to benefit them greatly.  Now, and from here forth, anything is online. What happened to my Mum could  happen to yours, or a small business, or a large corporation. Organisations  need to invest in proper cybersecurity measures to protect themselves, their  clients and our society.</p>

    <h2>Topic 3: Machine Learning</h2>
    <h3>What does it do</h3>
    <p>Machine Learning is the use of algorithms and statistical  models to enable a computer to complete tasks without explicit instructions. Instead,  computers often rely on the use of patterns and inference. </p>
    <p>Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence used  to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; a computer to learn based on &ldquo;previous experiences&rdquo;. It is an  iterative approach to learning, adapting its algorithm with each iteration.  When initially learning a task, a machine learning program will likely attempt  random approaches to the task. From this basis, the following iterations will  take the most successful of the previous attempts and build upon it. Each repetition  should be more successful than the previous one, eventually being successful at  the task. </p>
    <p>Machine Learning has become very successful. When  implemented well, the machine will completing the task most of the time, though  very rarely 100% of the time. There is almost always a random variable that can  affect the outcome, especially when dealing with external inputs such as audio  or image inputs. Enabling the machine learning program to be connected to the  internet allows it to have an incredibly large amount of input data. More input  data greatly increasing the ability to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; and adapt.</p>
    <p>Machine Learning has many current applications in a variety  of fields including retail, financial services, entertainment and transport. In  retail, Machine Learning detects customer buying patterns. Then, sends the  buyer personalised advertisements. The customer is shown items that they find more  interesting than conventional advertisements, increasing the likelihood of them  purchasing. In Social Media, sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter use  a similar method to link users together. They offer up similar users/accounts  to follow by comparing the users you follow, and posts you like with what other  people are doing, following and liking. Entertainment services, such as  YouTube, Netflix and Spotify, have their algorithms which learn the type of  content you are more likely to consume. Machine Learning tracks watch/listen  time, attentiveness rate (what percentage of the content you get through before  clicking something else) and likes/dislikes, to display things that it believes  you will also enjoy. </p>
    <p>Near future applications of machine learning include things  such as a network of self-driving vehicles, allowing for things like autonomous  delivery and taxi services. Machine learning is also progressing in voice and  video synthesis, creating convincing fake audio and video of real people known  as &ldquo;deep fakes&rdquo;. This has many applications some good, others questionable.</p>
    <h3>What is the likely impact</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Machine Learning will change industries. Adding machine  learning to a process will allow some industries to run more autonomously.  Other industries will be able to run more efficiently by being able to analyse  data and predict future outcomes at a much more consistent rate. <br>
      One sector likely to change in a big way is transport. Transport  is a big industry. The introduction of self-driving vehicles may soon make truck  driving mostly redundant, as autonomous trucks will be able to travel long-distance  journeys without stopping, giving them a big lead over human drivers. They will  also be more consistent, and predictable and therefore safer and less likely to  be involved in trip delaying incidents. While many drivers may be out a job,  this will also likely create positions for maintaining the autonomous vehicles  as without a human driver there is no one to correct any errors made during the  journey, so maintaining the cars will be critical in ensuring they are  functioning correctly. Driverless taxi and delivery services will also be much  more consistent, able to give customers much more accurate time estimates for  arrival and trip time, while also reducing the labour costs. Obviously, this  will greatly reduce transport jobs, but it will also create additional jobs in  the maintaining of these vehicles.</p>
    <h3>How will this affect you</h3>
    <p>As someone who does not drive and relies a large amount on  public transport, I see a lot of upsides. The increase in availability and  affordability of the driverless transport services would mean that I could rely  on a more consistent transport industry. This would also create safer roads. Autonomous  vehicles would behave in a much more consistent and predictable manner.  The changed conditions may condition people  who continue to drive to drive better. A critical mass of autonomous vehicles  would also allow for road speeds to increase as a network of vehicles would be  unlikely to cause an accident with another vehicle within the network. Other  applications of machine learning such as fraud detection will help increase  personal financial security.</p>
    <h2>Topic 4: Clouds, services, servers</h2>
    <h3>What does the Cloud do</h3>
    <p>Cloud computing is the act of accessing another computer  system over the internet and using this remote computers resources for you own  purpose. This a simple thing, but the scale it which it is now do allows the  cloud to do so much.  <br>
      For a home user, a common cloud service would be a simple  file storage repository. This appeals for the everyday user because it can be  accessed from anywhere, for example Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox. By uploading  files to the OneDrive or Dropbox &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, you can access these files from any  other computer (so long as you logged onto your cloud service account). The  cloud is acting as an extra hard drive in this case.</p>
    <p>For a small business, a common cloud service could be an  email/file server. Instead of having a local server that stores email and  files, these services are provided by the cloud. One advantage of this is cost  reduction, especially for a small business. A small business server running in  an office requires equipment, maintenance, a cold server room, backup management  and procedures for physical tapes. On top of this, a staff member to maintain  all this bulky IT infrastructure. The cloud in this circumstance act as a  sub-contract for traditional small business IT work.</p>
    <p>For small business, in addition to the reduced operational  costs, there is scaling and responsiveness advantages to cloud technology. Say  for instance, a small company has 350 staff members but suddenly merges with  another company that has 200 staff members, in which they will all move into  the same building. What the cloud service will do is allow the available  computer capacity to expand also instantaneously to the sudden higher demand.  If handled inhouse, expensive IT infrastructure changes may possibly be  required to accommodate the larger company.</p>
    <p>A full-stack developer may have other uses for cloud  computing services. A developer can make use of virtual online servers. Instead  of requiring a server at home to run a web application the developer can rent  servers from online. This can be incredibly useful to the lone full-stack  developer, and, as for small business, especially scaling. Cloud services scale  to the demand. Cloud based websites don&rsquo;t crash because of sudden traffic  increases like they did in the past. The cost of providing the service reflects  the usage of the service. A developer can scale their web application platform  back down to a reasonable cost if the user count suddenly drops off again.</p>
    <p>Systems administrators also use the cloud. They might use it  to clone Linux servers to quickly mass produce new web applications with minor  changes, alongside easy backup and built in security. Yet another use cloud  services have for the full-stack developer is cloud services providing public  IP&rsquo;s to use, so straight away they can have their web applications ready and  available on the internet without having to register expensive public IP  services from their local internet service provider.<br>
      Cloud computing is often broken down into three categories,  those being: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), </li>
      <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS) and </li>
      <li>Software as a Service (SaaS). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the cloud service  company providing basic servers as the product. Platform as a Service (PaaS)  gives a more basic sever setup where patching, networking and other basic  server tasks are managed by the cloud company itself. Software as a Service  (SaaS) is where the cloud company provides a front facing software package  where all behind the scenes maintenance is managed by the cloud service  company.</p>
    <h3>What is the impact of Cloud</h3>
Six billion people are  predicted to be living in cities by the year 2045 (un.org. 2020). Cloud will be  to a vital utility within the future cities, as important as roads, water,  power and sewage. The smart cities will have embedded technology supporting  this mega urbanization (Forbes.com. 2020).     Cloud technology will have a  great impact on healthcare. Many hospitals relying on cloud services to process  larger amounts of patients. Cloud supported machine learning AI will help  diagnose patients and larger data storage capacities to keep up with the  ever-growing data needs of hospitals and clinics (Cloud Standards Customer  Council 2017).     Computers themselves with  change. It has been predicted that at the end of 2020, work will generally no  longer be done on standalone workstations or personal computers. Instead all  work will be done using web cloud apps such as Microsoft Office Online and  google docs. The idea of installing software on a local machine is also going  to be a thing of the past, as most major software suites move onto the cloud as  their preferred method of distribution (The Future of Cloud Computing 2010).    Another impact of cloud  computing will be the increased use and acceptance of open source software.  Most of the cloud now is fuelled with open source software, and it looks like  the current trend of cloud technology is that it will continue to drive open  source software into the mainstream as cloud technology grows (TechRepublic.com  2020).
    <h3>How will Cloud affect you</h3>
    <p>The effect is already being felt. Most of us now no longer  purchase software and install it on our local machines, but rather use software  that is hosted on the cloud. Alongside this is the day to day use of the cloud  for file sharing, photo sharing, music sharing and the use of social media  which relies heavily on cloud technology. <br>
      We are all aware of the privacy concerns and ownership  rights. It is common for people to store their entire personal lives on the  cloud, from important documents to baby photos. How companies will use our  personal cloud data will have a huge impact and effect on our lives.<br>
      As developers, cloud technology gives us incredibly easy,  cheap and flexible options. We can start creating and hosting web apps, which  previously would not have been possible to start without huge personal  investment. As cloud technology matures, more and more easily accessible server  configurations are available to the everyday user. These include the ability to  quickly start web applications with pre-built &lsquo;snapshots&rsquo; of common Linux  configurations, considerably cutting down work time.<br>
      Microsoft and Amazon both offer an incredible amount of easy  to use libraries, modules and prebuilt servers to build any kind of application  you would want and be able to scale it to your needs for very low start-up  costs. Some advanced modules such as artificial intelligence will allow the  everyday website entrepreneur to create world class web applications without  the need for huge budgets and dedicated research. As these advanced cloud  artificial intelligence modules grow in both size and complexity, complicated  projects will be much easier for myself and other developers to use.</p>

    <h1>Project Idea English as a Second Language Flashcard system.</h1>
    <h2>Overview </h2>
    <p>The Red Panthers project idea is to create an English as a  Second Language (ESL) flashcard system for teaching basic English nouns to  children learning English. The application will be created using Unity3D  alongside Microsoft Visual Studio and written in C#. This software will teach  basic English to children using a flashcard system with mini-games to keep the  children interested and engaged through the process.</p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>People worldwide consider English to be the most valuable  language to learn as a second language (Taylor, 2020). Research has predicted  that the market for learning English as a second language will grow 7.1% and is  expecting to hit the $54.8 billion mark by 2025 (Research, 2020). Our  motivation is to tap into this growing market and help children learn some  English in areas of the world that do not have access to native English  speakers to teach them, such as Vietnam where there is currently a lack of  English teachers available (News 2020 ). </p>
    <h2>Description </h2>
    <h3>Features </h3>
    <p>The ESL flashcard system will start with these features,  with the possibility to expand and add more features later as needed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>main menu</li>
      <li>collection of stock flashcards (showing a  picture and the English noun below it)</li>
      <li>flashcard selection screen to choose the  appropriate flashcards</li>
      <li>a system which allows users to add their own  flashcards and associated voice recording</li>
      <li>&lsquo;Click the correct card&rsquo; mini-game</li>
      <li>&lsquo;Memory&rsquo; mini-game</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Program Flow  Overview (small heading):<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Main Menu </h3>
    <p>The main menu will consist of three buttons: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>&lsquo;Correct Card Game&rsquo; </li>
      <li>&lsquo;Memory Game&rsquo; </li>
      <li>&lsquo;Exit Application&rsquo; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clicking either of the game buttons will proceed to load up  the selected mini-game, whereas the exit button will simply exit the  application. The application will have an appropriate background image and a  simple music loop.</p>
    <h3>Flashcard Selection </h3>
    <p> The flashcard selection will have a large pane that will consist of  all flashcards currently in the flashcard data folder. Each flashcard will have  an audio file (.mp3) to show how the word is pronounced.<br>
      The user will have to select six flashcards. As the user  clicks flashcards, they will turn green. Once the user has chosen six  flashcards, they will continue to the game they previously selected.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Correct Card Game </h3>
    <p>A row of six flashcards will be displayed face up. The  application pronounces one of the cards and the user then has 10 seconds to  click on the matching flashcard. The user gets one point for a correct answer,  or one point deducted for a wrong answer. The round will end when the  application has finished reading all the flashcards. The game will not repeat  the same flashcard twice.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Memory Game</h3>
    <p>A grid of flashcards is displayed, which is each of the six  flashcards loaded twice, then distributed randomly on the screen. The  flashcards are face down. The user will then click flashcards in pairs, looking  for matches. As the card turns over, the audio plays.  The user gets a point every time they fail to  reveal a matching pair. The round ends when the user has matched all the pairs.  The aim is to do it in the least number of moves, i.e. the lowest score.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Tools And technology:</h2>
    <p>The software required for this project will be Unity3d,  Microsoft Visual Studio, Gimp photo manipulation suite. All this software is  license-free for non-commercial use and so is acceptable to use for this  project.<br>
      The hardware required for our group is a computer capable of  running Unity3d and Microsoft Visual Studio, a microphone for recording audio  and an internet connection so that we can collaborate online.</p>
    <h2>Skills Required:</h2>
    <p>Our team will need to develop many skills to complete this  project. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>programming skills to create the software in  Unity3D </li>
      <li>graphic design skills to create the flashcards  and backgrounds in Gimp or another suitable image manipulation software. </li>
      <li>Technical writing skills to create build  documentation </li>
      <li>Creative writing skills to make clear, engaging  instructions for users</li>
      <li>Liaison skills to engage consultants to work on  making the game multi-lingual</li>
      <li>Video editing skills for presentation purposes, </li>
      <li>basic audio editing skills to create sounds for  the flashcards and repeating background music </li>
      <li>project management skills to plan and manage the  build </li>
      <li>leadership skills to help us stay focused and on  task</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Outcome:</h2>
    <p>The outcome of this project will be the creation of a  flashcard system to help children learn basic English words. The application  will be a small but workable product that our team would be able to market on a  standalone website or put on app stores. <br>
      Users will be able to add their own flashcards.  This will empower the end-user to customise  the app for use in ways that fit their particular ESL curriculum.<br>
      We hope that the software will be available for remote  communities who don&rsquo;t have high-end technology or qualified teachers to teach  English.</p>

    <h1>Group Reflections</h1>
    <h2>Anthony Brown</h2>
    <h3>What went well?</h3>
    <p>I believe  we had a group of people that wanted to make the group work and were prepared  to work to that end. This was reflected in our ability to be decisive by  sharing our opinions and then respecting the group consensus.  Once a decision was made everyone  effortlessly moved to the next work item.</p>
    <h3>What could be improved? </h3>
    <p>I found our communication channels a bit stinted.  We took a while to find the communication  methods that suited the group. We could have been more productive in the middle  part of the project. If we had got our communication working better earlier  then we may have avoided this.</p>
    <h3>At least one thing that was  surprising?</h3>
    <p>We all occupy different time zones and have different work  requirements. This didn&rsquo;t cause nearly as much problems as I initially thought  it might. Remote communication helped us deal with it. Each member could pick  up where the last had left off.</p>
    <h3>At least one thing that you  have learned about groups?</h3>
    <p>Groups work  best when everyone one is contributing.</p>
    <h2>Tim Damon</h2>
    <h3>What went well?</h3>
    <p>The group was very well organised, using several different outlets for  the organisation such as Trello, Slack, Discord and GitHub. Everyone picked up  several parts of the project to complete themselves, agreeing to collaborate it  all through GitHub. We had a clear list of tasks and who was assigned to what  through the Trello board setup by Anthony.</p>
    <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
    <p>Tasks assigned could be completed more quickly (myself included). More  consistent group chats (through Discord) as we only got together a few times  and it was never able to be all of us at once.</p>
    <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
    <p>How easy it was to organise everything with each person in the group  without ever getting to meet face to face. Trello made creating a list of tasks  and assigning them incredibly easy and that list was always there so you knew  what needed doing and who was doing what.</p>
    <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>
    <p>That each individual putting in effort helps everyone else work load  and that organisation is key, effective organisation can turn a large task into  something much more manageable.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Shaun Lottey </h2>
    <h3>What went well?</h3>
    <p>I feel that all members of group were well organised and great  communicators. Thanks to tools provided by different members such as Trello, we  were able to quickly and effectively organise what seemed a colossal task into  a much more manageable agenda. Group cohesion was almost effortless when  assigning tasks or implementing ideas.</p>
    <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
    <p>Due to the timing of the year with Christmas, it was difficult for us  all to remain in constant contact throughout. A more regimented communication  schedule, like a set few times each week to catch up would be beneficial to us,  although this is difficult with conflicting work schedules.</p>
    <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
    <p>Honestly, how easily the group worked together. Each task  was put before us, assigned and completed with people asking for help if they  needed it, and help being given in kind. For the limited times we were all able  to speak live it was an outright pleasant experience.</p>
    <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h3>
    <p>Team work  makes the dream work. Knowing you have the support of your peers makes daunting  challenges a lot more manageable.</p>
    <h2>Jake McAndrew </h2>
    <h3>What went well?</h3>
    <p>I feel our group was very well organised, I&rsquo;ve never used  trello before, but it was a very useful tool to keep up to date on what needed  to be done. Even though I found it very difficult to be online at the same time  as the other group members due to my work schedule, I still feel like I always  had clear direction on what needed to be done thanks to other team members.</p>
    <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
    <p>I feel like the team worked pretty well together, the only  major improvement I can see has to do with my personal time management and  being more involved in group calls and discussions. </p>
    <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
    <p>One thing that was surprising was how organised and friendly  everyone was. I have never done group work over the internet before and I was  very surprised how smoothly everything went even with my limited time. </p>
    <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>
    <p>Group work is so much easier when everyone communicates and  is organised </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Jason Tilgner </h2>
    <h3>What went well?</h3>
    <p>The team had some good organisation every was keen to get  into the assignment, we probably didn&rsquo;t have much of a structure at the start  but Anthony was able to organise us and sort of become our team adviser. We  used some different industry tools to be able to organise and set up a clear  schedule, on who had to do what and when. Everyone was able to complete their  part and make proper updates into GitHub. Some of the tools we used where  trello, slack, and discord. It was also interesting to see everyone&rsquo;s different  industry views.</p>
    <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
    <p>Just a bit of hesitation at the start to get tasks started  and probably not spreading them out as late as we have. At some points it felt  like it was taking a bit long on certain tasks.</p>
    <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
    <p>How easy and quick it was to organise everyone to get in  communication to work out tasks and who was doing what. That everyone went off  and did the task required, and generally above what was required. That members  asking for each other opinions or asking for help if unsure, instead of just  doing their own thing.<br>
      At least  one thing that you have learned about groups?<br>
      That being organised at the start helps and that having  helpful + willing team mates makes everything a lot smoother.</p>
    <h2>Jason Walstab </h2>
    <h3>What went well?</h3>
    <p>What went well was the good organisation via Trello, an organisational  online application, thanks to Anthony Brown. This allowed us to really focus on  what we had to do as well as well have a clear list and direction on what we  should be working on, who should be working on what and when things are done.  Another highlight was the IT interview organised by Shaun Lottey which was very  insightful as the IT professional we interviewed had great insights into the IT  industry. </p>
    <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
    <p>Meeting deadlines and getting work done faster, sometimes we seem to  have been trailing at a slower pace than I would have liked, and the group work  ended up being dragged out over a longer period than I thought we would get it  done in. </p>
    <h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
    <p>I was surprised at how effective it was to communicate and work online  without the need for face to face interaction. In some ways it was more  effective than working onsite in a team as we could easily post and share our  documents in a central location. </p>
    <h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h3>
    <p>I have learned that organisation is key and that the better organised  we are as a team the faster work gets done, which in a way is more important  than peoples individual skill level. </p>
    <h2>Main Group Reflection: </h2>
    <p>Holding the  group together has been out tools: GitHub, which we have used to combine all  our resources, Trello, where we have meticulously planned our journey, Slack,  which has been where we have done our chat groups, and our frequent meetings  over discord when we were sick of typing. <br>
      These tools  have really been the backbone for this group and have allowed us to work as a  team regardless of distance or time zones. We believe that, without these tools  the work would not have been possible. We all feel that what went well was the  setting up of these tools from the start to ensure everyone could follow along  and contribute as necessary. This allowed us to establish as clear workflow  structure that we could all follow.<br>
      Coming from  all different backgrounds, places, jobs, educational and technical levels we have  managed to work well as a team mainly thanks to good organisational structure  and a fair level of contribution among all our team members.<br>
      One area we  feel we could have improved on is a more standard format for file contributions  and uploads, as filenames and commit comments got a bit crazy towards the end  with different versions of files in the GitHub repository and no common  standard for commit comments or version numbers on documents. Towards the end  it did get better as we organised the GitHub repository to better handle our  documents and commits.<br>
      Something  that was surprising was the spread of everyone's different skills and areas of  expertise that helped us to gain insights from perspectives that we do not see  for ourselves. This mix of different skills and experience did not result in  conflicts among members, but instead really helped use work together.<br>
      The thing  we have all learned is that communication is key in doing group projects, and  the more communication we had the quicker we were able to finish off sections  of the assignment. This was especially critical towards the end of the  assignment, when we needed to start putting everything together into a single,  workable project page.<br>
      We started  off to a slow and rocky start but in the end have pulled through and hopefully  have done an excellent job. All of us feel that together we have been able to  manage this workload better than expected and are excited to move onto the main  IT project side of things.</p>
